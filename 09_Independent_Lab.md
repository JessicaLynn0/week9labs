# Independent Lab: Inferential Statistics

In this assignment you will practice implementing statistical approaches in Python. For this assignment, please complete the following tasks using the [ect_data.txt](/data/ect_data.txt) dataset. This dataset represents an assessment of employeesâ€™ adoption of a new system within an organization. Specifically, the dataset contains responses to questionnaire items about attitudes toward a system, intention to use a system, perceived usefulness of the system, and satisfaction with the system.

## Linear and Multiple Regression

* Using `intent1_01` as the target variable, create a regression model using only 5 of the other numerical variables
  * Do not include `intent1_02`, `intent1_03`, and `intent1_04` as independent variables
* Assess the validity of the assumptions of 
  * linearity,
  * collinearity,
  * homoscedasticity,
  * independence,
  * and normality.
* Assess your model's F-test and T-tests. 
  * Which variables are significant? Based on what assessment? 
  * Choose two significant variables. From a business perspective, why are they significant?
* Provide the equation for your model and interpret the results.

**Save your notebook with output showing your code has been successfully executed and then submit for grading.**
